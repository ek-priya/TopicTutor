    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    We understand that high school education lays the foundation for a student’s future learning and 
    career path. To nurture interest and build confidence in core subjects, Topic Tutor aims to make 
    learning more effective and engaging by providing topic-wise educational content through animated lessons,
     real-life examples, and multilingual explanations—helping students not 
     just understand, but enjoy what they learn.
  </div><br>
  <div>
    <h2>Our Objective</h2>
    The objective of our project is to enhance the learning experience of high school students 
      by providing access to difficult academic topics through diverse teaching methods such as animated videos,
       real-time examples, and multilingual explanations. This approach aims to make complex 
      concepts easier to understand, engaging, and accessible to a wider range of learners.
